# Next-Gen-NLP-Classifier-Using-Transformer-Models

This project aims to build a **scalable and robust NLP text classification system** that leverages **state-of-the-art transformer models** (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to automatically categorize text into multiple classes with high accuracy and minimal manual feature engineering. Transformers model long-range dependencies and semantic context far better than traditional approaches like bag-of-words or TF-IDF.  

The current workflow performs **data loading, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, setting the stage for transformer-based fine-tuning in the next steps.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- **Preprocess text data** by combining titles with full text and cleaning out missing or empty entries.  
- **Explore the dataset** to understand class balance, text length distributions, and sample content per label.  
- **Visualize key characteristics** such as class distributions and word count histograms.  
- **Prepare the dataset** (train/validation split) for later use with transformer models.  
- **Set up a scalable NLP pipeline** that can later be extended with transformer models for classification.

## 🚀 Future Scope & Next Steps

- **Transformer Fine-Tuning:** Train transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT) on this dataset for superior performance compared to traditional models.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs for best results.  
- **Long Text Strategies:** Implement truncation, sliding window, or hierarchical approaches for texts longer than model token limits.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Analyze model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.  
- **Deployment:** Package the trained model as a REST API or web application for real-time inference.  
- **Benchmarking:** Compare performance against baseline TF-IDF + SVM models to quantify improvements.
